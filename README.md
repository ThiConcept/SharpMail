SharpMail
=========

After that GMailNotifier was ended, it missed me to have this little icon for my emails without having to launch a browser.  
So I create a new gmail notifier client in C# => SharpMail

Installation
------------
You can get the window executable file (and its configuration file) from the release part (bin/release), and just run.

Config
------
When the app is launch, on the tray Icon:  
On a left click, you can access to your box, force the refresh, show again all not read mail, and exit the app  
On a right click, you have the settings, and the about.  

All settings are saved by email.

For the "color picker" it's from the example of MSDN  
For the "protect data" the code is not from me, but I lost the name of the source
